# HXML Tree-Sitter Grammar

This is a work in progress [Tree-Sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) grammar for [Hxml](https://haxe.org/manual/compiler-usage-hxml.html) which is the markup language for [Haxe](https://haxe.org/).

The goal is this project to learn enough about Tree-Sitter to be able to write / update the syntax for Haxe.
